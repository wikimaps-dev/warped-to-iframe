# Warped Maps to IFrames

Example of embeddable URL:
`https://tools.wmflabs.org/warped-to-iframe/map.php?pageid=35092716`

The view should automatically fit to the warped map. In the future it would be nice to have a search/settings page for generating all HTML code needed to embed maps externally at `index.php`.

## Optional Parameters

```
lang=sv
```
This sets the language of the background map, all values available through Wikimedia Maps are valid.

```
opacity=true
```

The `opacity` parameter will add a opacity slider to the map, allowing users to compare the underlaying base-map with the georeferenced one.
