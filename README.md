# Warped Maps to IFrames

Example of embeddable URL:
`http://tools.wmflabs.org/warped-to-iframe/map.php?pageid=35092716`

The view should automatically fit to the warped map. In the future it would be nice to have a search/settings page for generating all HTML code needed to embed maps externally at `index.php`.
